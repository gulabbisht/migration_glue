And even newest browsers are rendering some things differently, eg. input fields, checkboxes or table captions; everything in one file is easier to maitenance; smaller number of requests to server; not every hack is \"hack\". Very often hack is just smart use selectors (not) supported only by specific browser;",

      "body": "A content management system (CMS) is a software tool that lets users add, publish, edit, or remove content from a website, using a web browser on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop computer. Typically, the CMS software is written in a scripting language, and its scripts run on a computer where a database and a web server are installed. The content and settings for the website are usually stored in a database, and for each page request that comes to the web server, the scripts combine information from the database and assets (JavaScript files, CSS files, image files, etc. that are part of the CMS or have been uploaded) to build the pages of the website.",
